### Local Variable Type Interface

- Adds syntactic sugart to Java
- Reduces the wordage/verboseness in writing Java code
- Keep Java type-safe

**Local variable type interface** means that you can declare variables **without having to specify the associated type**.

####**var** is not a general keyword.

- **var** is a reserved type name or context-sensitive keyword

- Code that uses **var** as a **variable**, **method**, or **package name will not be affected**

- Code that uses **var** as a **class or intreface name will be affected**
